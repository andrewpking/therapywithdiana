        <p>I am passionate about my work with people and tackling all of the problems and challenges that come your way on a day-to-day basis. With a focus on personalized care and client satisfaction, I am always working to exceed my clients’ high standards and expectations.</p>
        <p>I started working in Salt Lake City in 1995 and can honestly say I have never looked back. I have worked in many different settings including substance abuse, severe mental illness, the emergency room, and private practice.  I have supervised nurses, social workers and nurse practitioners, as well as, trained many master's students in general and geriatric social work.  Maintaining my reputation as an accomplished Social Worker means making sure my clients have complete and total confidence in my services, and I’m proud to be recognized as one of the best in the business.</p>
